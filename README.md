# Image Captioning

We reimplemented the complicated [Google' Image Captioning](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/im2txt) model by simple TensorLayer code.

### 1. Prepare MSCOCO data and Inception model
Go to ``data`` folder.

### 2. Train the model
via ``train.py``

### 3. Evaluate the model
via ``evaluate.py``

### 4. Generate captions by given image and model
via ``run_inference.py``
